     Frameworks uses Java Script libaries code, by using pre written codes for programs, this saves time for web developers.
     Java Script helps programming planning,<br> by not having to enter codes again when using Java Frameworks. When
     exported from libraries, can use JS libraries for<br> data visualization and data in charts and maps to analyze data easily.
